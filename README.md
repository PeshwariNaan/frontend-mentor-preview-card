## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I havn't worked with Sass in a long time and wanted to relearn it. I typically use React with styled-components or css modules so I don't have much use for other methods. I do think it's a good skill to keep up to date and I indeed had forgotten much. This was a good simple project to help regain some lost knowledge.



### Continued development

I'm always finding new and more elegent ways to work with css. It's very easy to over complicate a simple design. Browsing through the other solutions on Frontend Mentor is always a great way to learn and improve.
